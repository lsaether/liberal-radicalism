#### [Liberty versus Monopoly](https://americanaffairsjournal.org/2018/11/liberty-versus-monopoly/) - American Affairs Journal Winter 2018 - Eric A. Posner and E. Glen Weyl
 - The authors argue that the current alliance of libertarians and business leaders is a convenience which will soon dissolve.
 - Includes the quote from Ohio Republic Senator John Sherman: "Monopolies are inconsistent with our form of government. . . . If we will not endure a king as a political power, we should not endure a king over the production, transportation, and sale of any of the necessaries of life. If we would not submit to an emperor, we should not submit to an autocrat of trade."
 - Introduces the concept of _labor market monopsony_ in which the effects of a "tax" on workers is enabled through the employer's ability to control the employee's wages due to the friction of changing jobs and careers.
  - Calls for a _data labor movement_ in which data unions will be able to organize, represent, and defend "those who create the inputs to the digital economy that are the basis of increasingly sophisticated artificial intelligence systems [and] bargain for the wages they are presently denied."
